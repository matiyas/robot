## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT create a public issue. Instead, please report it to us by following these steps:

1.  **Private Disclosure**: Report the vulnerability privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/matiyas/robot/security/advisories/new).
2.  **Wait for Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
3.  **Coordinated Disclosure**: We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to fix it and release a new version.

## What to Include in a Report

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept code or scripts are very helpful).
- Any information about the environment in which you discovered the vulnerability (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS version, Docker version).

Thank you for helping keep Robot Tank Control secure!
